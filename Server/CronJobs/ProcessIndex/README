ProcessIndex.py is meant to be run as a CRON. It will produce a new index.html page
and place it in the /tmp directory. It technically creates the file 

/tmp/new_index.html

The assumption is another CRON will pick this file up and overwrite the 
index.html page of the site periodically.

You run ProcessIndex.py as follows ...

python ProcessIndex.py

Note: if you have a problem it might be because the HeadlineGrabbers directory
might not be on the python path. So from a CRON you may need a sheel script
which first sets the PYTHON_PATH environment variable to include this dirctory

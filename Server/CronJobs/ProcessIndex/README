Just run ProcessIndexCron.sh every 5 minutes from a CRON tab entry

Note: if you have a problem it might be because the HeadlineGrabbers directory
might not be on the python path. So from a CRON you may need a shell script
which first sets the PYTHON_PATH environment variable to include this dirctory
